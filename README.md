#### By **Ian Cook Westgate**

## Description

A website created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery where a user can submit a pizza order and get a pizza price returned. The most important part of this website is in the code, where the JavaScript functionality has an emphasis on using constructors and objects within the business logic.

### Specs

Spec: The program accepts multiple inputs from the user and calculates a cost result.
  - Input: "Cheese, Mushroom, Large"
  - Output: "$20"
